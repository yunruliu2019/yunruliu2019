the beginning of design was to great many modules then adding all the parameter 
then plug in to created dictionary. then later I found that using pandas would be the best way to solve it, 
can use the pandas to build a framework then use function dict to convert the dataframe to dictionary.

this is one of the method to solve the problem but definitly not the only method, 
because pandas require restricted syntax on using its function. programmer may 
end up spend more time on checking the syntax of pandas than writing a long list of coding.
